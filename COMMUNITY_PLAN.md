Our main expertise is software architecture, cloud solutions, IT development and maintenance. As such, our focus
will be on providing technical guidance, assistance with ICOs and converting existing blockchain setups to TRON.

A good portion of our everyday consulting involves startup planning for an ICO, and we would recommend the TRON
platform for this purpose, promote and use TRX based tokens ourselves and through the affiliated startups.

We have modest online presence at the moment with limited outreach, and have not been actively involved in the
crypto community. However, the goal is to add a new team member to manage community relations in the near future.

As a team, our distributed locations, and diverse cultural and educational backgrounds should allow us to provide
around the clock technical support as well as establish and maintain business relations and make contributions to the
TRON community.
