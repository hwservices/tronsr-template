With the emergence of the blockchain technology, we see a new world of possibilities of providing our software services in exchange for crypto-tokens as well as easily paying engineers across the globe.

Тhe ICO model is increasingly popular with the Silicon Valley startups, and many companies seek a platform that would support smart contracts, provide inexpensive transactions, be scalable and reliable in addition to offering de-centralized applications.
