## Hello World

Hello World is a software development company with a vision to establish a different platform for creating
innovative software products. We are building a portfolio of early stage startup companies that need engineering
work â€“ a website, MVP, mobile app, API, blockchain, or the first version of their online platform.

Our locations are in the US (California and Florida), Argentina (Buenos Aires), Bulgaria (Sofia) and
Russia (Moscow, St, Petersburg).

With the emergence of the blockchain technology, we see a new world of possibilities of providing our software services
in exchange for crypto-tokens as well as easily paying engineers across the globe.

In addition, the ICO model is increasingly popular with the Silicon Valley startups, and many companies seek a platform
that would support smart contracts, provide inexpensive transactions, be scalable and reliable in addition to
offering de-centralized applications.

We would like to offer our support, software development and IT expertise to the TRON foundation and become one of
its SR.
